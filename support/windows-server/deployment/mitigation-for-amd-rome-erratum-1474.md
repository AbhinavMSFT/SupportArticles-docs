# Mitigation for AMD Rome Erratum 1474: A CPU core may hang after about 1044 days

This article introduces how to fix the AMD Rome Erratum 1474: A CPU core may hang after about 1044 days. The erratum is documented in [Revision Guide for AMD Family 17h Models 30h-3Fh Processors](https://www.amd.com/system/files/TechDocs/56323-PUB_1.01.pdf).

## More about AMD Rome Erratum 1474

This issue is due to a processor core failing to exit hardware CC6 idle sleep state after approximately 1044 days from the last system reset.

An active processor runs at power state C0 when there's work being done. However, if the processor doesnâ€™t have work, it may go into an idle sleep-state. There are different levels or depths of sleep. The deeper the sleep, the more power savings, and the longer it takes to get back to C0.

Suggested workarounds include either rebooting system before the projected time of failure (potentially then disabling CC6 in BIOS) or disabling deep CC6 idle sleep state by programming MSRC001_0296 (using System-OEM-supported methods).

## Use powercfg to fix the issue in Windows

We recommend using the Windows-native [powercfg](/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/powercfg-command-line-options) utility to fix the issue in Windows. The powercfg utility ships as part of Windows and is used to control power schemes on the system. The utility can be used to control processor idle or sleep states.

The powercfg utility has an IDLESTATEMAX (Processor Idle State Maximum) parameter. An IDLESTATEMAX value of 0 indicates no limit imposed on the maximum processor sleep-level/c-state depth. A value of 1 allows depth to C1, the shallowest sleep state.

By using the powercfg utility, we can prevent the processor from entering its deeper C2 (For example, hardware CC6) idle sleep state, thus mitigating the errata. To do so, run the following command in an elevated Command Prompt window:

```console
powercfg -setacvalueindex scheme_current sub_processor IDLESTATEMAX 1
powercfg -setactive scheme_current
```
