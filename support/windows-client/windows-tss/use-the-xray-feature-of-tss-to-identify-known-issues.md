# Identify known issues by using the xray feature of TSS

[TSS](https://aka.ms/TssInfo) is a Microsoft PowerShell based toolset that can be used to collect troubleshooting data. The collected data can be analyzed to help identify the root cause of a problem in Windows clients and Server.

xray is a built-in feature of TSS. It aims to automate the detection of known issues and help resolve them with minimal time and effort. TSS runs the xray feature during data collection. If any known issues are found, it generates report(s) with details of the issue and the possible resolutions. xray may also show them on screen. Report files are in the TSS data set, in the .zip file generated by TSS.

The report files can be reviewed by an administrator or a support professional, to check if you a known issue occurs.

Xray runs by default. All you need to do is open the report, read it, and then check if a known issue occurs.

## How to find the xray report

In the .zip file generated by TSS, or within psSDP*.zip file within the TSS*.zip file, you will find:

- xray_ISSUES-FOUND_*.txt (known issue detected)
- xray_INFO_*.txt (a known issue of a lesser impact detected)

> [!NOTE]
> TSS will prompt you to automatically update if needed when you run it. It is highly recommended that you keep TSS up to date so that you have the latest TSS and xray updates. If your TSS is outdated, you may miss out on any recently discovered issues that have been added to xray.

## Example scenario: how to use the xray report to resolve an issue
