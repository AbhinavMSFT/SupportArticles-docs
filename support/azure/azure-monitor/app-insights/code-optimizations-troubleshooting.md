## Keep checking back
    
If you meet all the requirements listed above, keep checking back for insights. Meanwhile, the service continues to analyze your profiles and provide insights as soon as it detects any issues in your code. After you enable the Application Insights Profiler, it may take a few hours for you to generate profiles and for the service to analyze them.
