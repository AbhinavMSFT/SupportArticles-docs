# Understanding Azure Batch Network resources creation

Azure Batch generates network resources such as Network Security Group (NSG), Public IP, and Load Balancer within your subscription. This article offers guidance on how to identify  network resources that are generated by the Azure Batch account and pool.

## Resource name

Azure Batch creates resources at the subscription level. The resources created by Azure Batch follow this format:

- An Azure Load Balancer named (Guid)-Azurebatch-cloudserviceloadbalancer
- An Azure Public IP address named (Guid)-Azurebatch-cloudservicepublicip
- A Network Security Group named (Guid)-Azurebatch-cloudservicenetworksecuritygroup


## Resource generated by Batch pool with virtual network integration

When a Batch pool is created using virtual network integration, the Azure Batch service automatically generates all necessary network resources for the pool's operation. These resources are created in the same resource group where the virtual network in use is located.

## Use the resource tag to access the linked Batch account or pool 

To identify the Batch resources linked to a specific network resource, you can access the resource and then check the **Tags** section. This will display information about the Batch account name and pool name. Please note that once the pool is resized to 0 or deleted, the associated network resources will also be deleted.
