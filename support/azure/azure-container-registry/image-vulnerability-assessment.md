# View image scanning result and in Microsoft Defender for Cloud 

This article describes how to view image scanning result and provides common steps to fix vulnerability in Microsoft Defender for Containers.

## View image scanning result

### Ensure the Agentless Container vulnerability assessments extension is enabled

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**. Under **Management**, select **Environment Settings** page.
1. Select your Azure subscription, then select **Settings**.
1. Ensure the **Agentless Container vulnerability assessments** extension is set to **On**.

## Cause

The tag that's associated with the image that you're trying to pull isn't found.

## Solution

Make sure that the tag exists within the associated repository and registry.

To find the tags within the associated repository and registry, use one of the following methods:

- In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), follow these steps:

  1. Search for and select **Container registries**.

  1. In the list of container registries, select the name of your container registry.
  
  1. In the menu pane of your container registry, select **Services** > **Repositories**.
  
  1. In the list of repositories within your container registry, select the name of the repository in which the tag should exist.
  
  1. Check whether the tag in question is shown within the list of tags in the repository.

- In Azure CLI, run the [az acr repository show-tags](/cli/azure/acr/repository#az-acr-repository-show-tags) command:

  ```azurecli
  az acr repository show-tags --name <my-registry> --repository <my-repository>
  ```

> [!NOTE]
> Checking the repositories from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) or running the `az acr repository show-tags` command works successfully only if the Azure Container Registry network rules allows these actions.
