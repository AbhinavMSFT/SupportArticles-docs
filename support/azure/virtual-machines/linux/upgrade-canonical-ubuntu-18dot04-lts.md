# Canonical Ubuntu 18.04 LTS is out of standard support on 31 May 2023

Even though Canonical Ubuntu 18.04 LTS is out of standard support on 31 May 2023, you can continue to use existing Azure Linux VMs running it. However, security, feature, and maintenance updates will no longer be provided by Canonical and may leave your systems vulnerable. We recommend that you either migrate to the next Ubuntu LTS release or upgrade to Ubuntu Pro to gain access to extended security and maintenance from Canonical.

## Upgrade to Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or Ubuntu 22.04

Transitioning to the latest operating system, such as [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/canonical.0001-com-ubuntu-server-focal?tab=Overview) or [Ubuntu Pro 22.04](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/canonical.0001-com-ubuntu-pro-jammy?tab=Overview) LTS, is important for performance, hardware enablement, and new technology benefits, and we recommend it for new instances. The transition may be a complex process for existing deployments. Therefore, it should be properly scoped and tested with your workloads. Although there's no direct upgrade path from Ubuntu 18.04 LTS to Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, you can directly upgrade to Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, and then to Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, or directly install Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. For more information, see the [Ubuntu Server upgrade guide](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/upgrade-introduction).

> [!NOTE]
> An in-place upgrade to a new major version (for exmaple, upgrading from Ubuntu 18.04 to 20.04) will cause a disconnection between the data plane and the [control plane](/azure/architecture/guide/multitenant/considerations/control-planes) of the virtual machine (VM). Azure capabilities such as [Auto guest patching](/azure/virtual-machines/automatic-vm-guest-patching), [Auto OS image upgrades](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-automatic-upgrade), [Hotpatching](/windows-server/get-started/hotpatch?toc=%2Fazure%2Fvirtual-machines%2Ftoc.json), and [Azure Update Manager](/azure/update-manager/overview) won't be available. To use these features, we recommended that you create a new VM by using your preferred operating system instead of performing an in-place upgrade.

## Upgrade to Ubuntu Pro â€“ Extended Security Maintenance to 2028

Ubuntu Pro includes security patching for all Ubuntu packages because of Extended Security Maintenance (ESM) for Infrastructure and Applications and optional full-time (24 hours a day, seven days a week) telephone and ticket support. Ubuntu Pro 18.04 LTS will remain fully supported until April 2028. Ubuntu Pro is available for free for personal and small-scale commercial users on up to five VMs and with transparent, per-machine pricing for enterprises. New VMs that run Ubuntu Pro can be deployed from the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/canonical.0001-com-ubuntu-pro-bionic?tab=Overview). You can also upgrade existing VMs to [Ubuntu Pro](https://ubuntu.com/pro) by purchasing from Canonical. For more information about Ubuntu 18.04 LTS End of Standard Support, see [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver) on Azure](https://ubuntu.com/18-04/azure).
