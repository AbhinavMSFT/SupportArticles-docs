# Custom Azure policy for validating controllers doesn't work

A custom Azure policy for validating controllers doesn't work. To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Use the Visual Studio extension designed for Azure Policy to generate the custom policy with the correct syntax. This can ensure that the policy is properly defined and adheres to the required format.
2. Create and validate custom policies to ensure that the custom policy for validating controllers functions correctly and meets the necessary requirements. For more information, see [Azure Policy for Kubernetes releases support for custom policy](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-governance-and-management/azure-policy-for-kubernetes-releases-support-for-custom-policy/ba-p/2699466).
