# Anonymous image pulls from Docker Hub to Azure Container Instances fail due to rate limits

This article provides a solution for errors that occur during anonymous image pulls from Docker Hub when you try to create or update an Azure container instance.

## Symptoms

When you try to create or update a container instance and pull images anonymously from Docker Hub using the Azure portal or Azure CLI, you receive an error message that resembles the following text:

> An error response is received from the docker registry 'index.docker.io'. Please retry later.
> Code: RegistryErrorResponse

## Cause

The "RegistryErrorResponse" error might occur due to the rate limits on image pulls from Docker Hub. An agreement between Microsoft and Docker to allow Azure IP addresses to make unlimited anonymous image pulls from Docker Hub ended on June 30, 2024.

### Determine the cause of the error

To confirm the error is caused by Docker Hub rate limit, look for the following errors:

- > ERROR: toomanyrequests: Too Many Requests.

- > You have reached your pull rate limit. You may increase the limit by authenticating and upgrading: https://www.docker.com/increase-rate-limits.

- > TOOMANYREQUESTS: too many requests to source registry for cache rule (name of customer's cache rule)

To look for the second error, follow these steps:

1. Run the following query:

    ```
    macro-expand isfuzzy=true ARMProdEG as X
    (
        X.database('Requests').EventServiceEntries
        | where PreciseTimeStamp > ago(1d)
        | where subscriptionId == "077cb7ef-4f7f-4b2d-8737-8f4c2571a5fb"
        | where resourceUri contains "/subscriptions/000000000-000000-000000-00000-0000000/resourceGroups/aci_applense_rg/providers/Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups/ac6"
        |where status contains "Failed"
        | extend error = extractjson('$.statusMessage', properties, typeof(string))
        | where error has 'RegistryErrorResponse'
        | project PreciseTimeStamp, correlationId, operationId, operationName, properties ,status,resourceUri
        | sort by PreciseTimeStamp desc
    )
    ```
2. Take the `correlationId` from the proceeding query result.

3. Execute the following query on the table `Traces`:

    ```
     cluster('accprod').database("accprod").Traces
    |where PreciseTimeStamp > ago (1d)
    |where subscriptionId =='000-00000-0000-000000-000000' and correlationId =='0000000-0000000-00000-00000-000000'
    |where message contains 'TOOMANYREQUESTS' or message contains 'validating'
    | project TIMESTAMP, message
    ```
    
    The query result reports the following error message:

    > Docker registry call failed: { "errors": [ { "code": "TOOMANYREQUESTS", "message": "You have reached your pull rate limit. You may increase the limit by authenticating and upgrading: https://www.docker.com/increase-rate-limit " } ] } . Uri: https://registry.hub.docker.com/v2/library/nginx/manifests/alpine . HttpStatusCode: 429

    This error message indicates the "RegistryErrorResponse" error is caused by Docker Hub rate limit.

## Solution

To resolve this issue, create a Docker account and use the Docker account credentials to authenticate the image pulls. This can immediately increase the rate limit. However, we strongly recommend using the Artifact Cache feature within Azure Container Registry (ACR) in conjunction with your Docker subscription. This allows you to configure an authenticated cache rule for caching images from Docker Hub to your ACR. You can then modify your build and deployment scripts to pull those same images directly from ACR.

> [!NOTE]
> Docker offers a free subscription that allows customers to get 200 pulls every 6 hours. If 200 pulls aren't enough for you, we recommend purchasing a paid Docker subscription. A paid Docker Subscription gives you 5,000 pulls every 24 hours, which can be increased by reaching out to Docker Directly.
