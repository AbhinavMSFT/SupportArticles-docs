# Corrupt user file error

This article helps you to resolve the corrupt user profile error.

## Symptoms

If you log in as the affected user, you'll get a temporary profile. This is a good indication that the profile is corrupt or you're a guest user. If you're a guest user, then you must be added to the appropriate groups.

## Resolution

If you aren't a guest user, follow the steps explained in [Fix a corrupted user profile in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/fix-a-corrupted-user-profile-in-windows-1cf41c18-7ce3-12f9-8e1d-95896661c5c9) to either (a) repair the profile or (b) delete and recreate the profile.
