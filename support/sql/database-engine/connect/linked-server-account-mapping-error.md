# Linked Server Account Mapping error

This article provides the cause, symptoms, and resolution of the linked server account mapping error.

## Symptoms

When you connect to the mid-tier server from the Management Studio, you might see the following error messages:

```output
> "Msg 233, Level 20, State 0, Line 0 
A transport-level error has occurred when sending the request to the server. (provider: Shared Memory Provider, error: 0 - No process is on the other end of the pipe.)"
```

When you connect using application developed using .NET, you might see the following error message:

> "The OLE DB provider "MSDASQL" for linked server "SQLPROD02" reported an error. Authentication failed."

> "Cannot initialize the data source object of OLE DB provider "MSDASQL" for linked server "SQLPROD02"."

If you also see the following error message, it indicates you are using Named Pipes for the linked server connection and a SQL login, and the mid-tier SQL Server service account or machine account doesnâ€™t have login rights to Windows on the backend server:

> "OLE DB provider "MSDASQL" for linked server "SQLPROD02" returned message "[Microsoft][SQL Server Native Client 11.0][SQL Server]Login failed for user 'CONTOSO\SQLPROD01$'."

## Solution

In the **Linked Server security** dialog, when you select the **Be made without using a security context** option, the "Login Failed" for user "NT AUTHORITY\ANONYMOUS LOGON" error is displayed. When you select **Be made with this security context**, the SQL login is successful.

You can correct this error by forcing TCP/IP or granting the appropriate permissions. In addition to the settings in the **Linked Server security** dialog, you can modify the individual account mappings in the upper portion of the dialog, which overrides the main mapping settings.

> [!NOTE]
> Using a SQL Server ODBC driver in a linked server isn't a supported scenario. Other ODBC drivers might have limited support from Microsoft and mainly from the vendor.
