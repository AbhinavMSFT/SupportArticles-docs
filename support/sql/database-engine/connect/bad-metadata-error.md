# Bad metadata error

This article helps you to resolve a problem when there is a bad metadata error.

A View or stored procedure which is used to query views in the linked server, receives login failures whereas a distributed `SELECT` statement copied from them doesn't. This might happen if the View was created and then the linked server was recreated, or a remote table was modified without rebuilding the View.
