# Connection issues after implementing cipher suite policies

## Symptoms

> "An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host. [SQLSTATE 42000] (Error 10054) OLE DB provider "" for linked server "DB name" returned message "Client unable to establish connection"."

If a cipher suite doesn't include RC4, any attempt to use RC4 for encryption will fail. Similarly, if a cipher suite includes RC4 but one of the parties involved doesn't support RC4, the handshake will fail, and the connection won't be established.

## Resolution

To resolve this issues, follow these steps:

Check the whether the `msds-supportedEncryptionType` property is set. When the property isn't set, it enables only RC4. To enable RC4, AES128, and AES256, set the value as *28*.

There are some more causes for the error message:

TLS_DHE Ciphers Enabled* -  

This issue also occurs when the client or server is hosted on Windows 2012,  2016 and higher versions. Despite both OS versions possessing the same cipher (TLS_DHE*), Windows 2012 and 2016+ handle cryptography keys within the TLS differently. This can result in communication errors. To resolve this issue, follow these steps: 

Remove all ciphers starting with "TLS_DHE*" from the local policy. For more information about  : errors that occur when applications try to connect to SQL Server in Windows, see   Applications experience forcibly closed TLS connection errors when connecting SQL Servers in Windows  

This issue might also occur when the client initiates the connection using TLS 1.0. Modern cipher suites often donâ€™t support TLS 1.0, preferring more secure versions like TLS 1.2. 

## Resolution

To fix this problem, follow these steps:

1. Make sure that the client's driver supports TLS 1.2 (update if necessary).

1. Add the following ciphers to the local policy to support TLS 1.0 communication:

   - `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA`
   - `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA`
   - `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA`
   - `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA`
