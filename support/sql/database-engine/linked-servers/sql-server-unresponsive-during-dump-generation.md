# SQL Server becomes unresponsive during SQL Server dump generation

This article helps you resolve an issue that might arise when SQL Server becomes unresponsive when a SQL Server dump is generated.

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- An assert dump is generated by SQL Server causing the SQL Server service to be unresponsive.
- You experience the following error message that mentions the assert expression `pilb->m_cRef == 0`. For more information on what asserts are and how to troubleshoot them, see [MSSQLSERVER_3624 - SQL Server](/sql/relational-databases/errors-events/mssqlserver-3624-database-engine-error).

- SQL Server becomes unresponsive during the dump process.

## Cause

Following are some conditions that can affect when the SQL Server dump is being generated:

- A remote query is executed using the `EXEC AT` command. For example:

  ```sql
  DECLARE @test NVARCHAR(MAX) = N'ABC'
  EXEC ('SELECT * FROM Customers.dbo.CustomerInformation WHERE CustomerId = ?', @test) AT [YourRemoteServer];
  ```

- A large object (LOB) argument is passed to the query.
  For more information about a list of LOB data types, see [Data types (Transact-SQL) - SQL Server](/sql/t-sql/data-types/data-types-transact-sql).

In the previous example, the `NVARCHAR(MAX)` variable is passed as a query parameter. One of the underlying requests submitted to the linked server fails.

You can also reproduce the issue by running the following query:

```sql
DECLARE @test NVARCHAR(MAX) = N'msdb' 
EXEC ('---SELECT * FROM sys.databases where name = ?', @test) AT [<server>\<instance>]
```

Avoid by using nonblob (BLOB) data type in your database design or code:

```sql
DECLARE @test NVARCHAR(5) = N'msdb' 
EXEC ('---SELECT * FROM sys.databases where name = ?', @test) AT  [<server>\<instance>]
```

## Resolution

This article will be updated as we find more information or guidance. Now, there's no permanent resolution. Microsoft is still investigating this issue. Until then, you can try the following workaround:

Change all `LOB` (Large Object) data types to fixed length data types (for example, convert `NVARCHAR(MAX)` to `NVARCHAR(200))`) that the input data length supports.
