## Cause 1: Bad OAuth token

The Salesforce connection, created using the Salesforce connector, maintains the authentication tokens for the connected user. The same authentication tokens are used to communicate with Salesforce. The bad OAuth token error occurs when the Salesforce connection is unable to renew the authentication tokens. 

## Cause 2: Expired or invalid session

The Salesforce session has reached its expiration time or the session has become invalid. This is based on the session configuration in Salesforce.

## Solution

You must perform any one of the following steps to resolve the issue:

- Select **Sign in again** in the error message, and then sign in to Salesforce again.
- [Sign out from Copilot for Sales](/microsoft-sales-copilot/sign-out-sales-copilot) and then sign in to Salesforce again.
