## Cause

The duplicate detection rules in CRM is configured to prevent specific fields from having duplicate values acorss multiple records. When a user tries to create a record from within Copilot for Sales, the duplicate detection rules in CRM prevents the creation of the record. For example, if the duplicate detection rules is configured to prevent the creation of a record with the same email address as an existing record, the record creation fails if the email address of the new record matches the email address of an existing record.

## Resolution

To resolve the error, do either of the following:

- Create the record again with a different value for the field that caused the error. For example, if the error occurred because the email address of the new record matches the email address of an existing record, create the record again with a different email address.

- Ask your administator to modify the duplicate detection rules in CRM to allow duplicate values for the field that caused the error.
