## Cause

User does not have permissions for the objects to view, create, or edit them in Copilot for Sales. At least read permissions are required for the objects to view them in Copilot for Sales. For example, if a user does not have read permissions for the Contact entity, contacts are not displayed in Copilot for Sales.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, you must update user profile permissions in Salesforce.

1. Sign in to Salesforce CRM as an administrator.
2. Go to **Setup** > **Administration** > **Users** > **Users**.
3. Find the user who is experiencing the issue and select the profile that the user is assigned to. Perform the following steps based on the profile type:
    - If the profile is not a custom profile, you must change the profile to the one that has correct permissions. 
    - If the profile is correct and is a custom profile, select **Edit**. In the **Standard Object Permissions** section, provide the required permissions.
1. Save the changes.

    > [!NOTE]
    > - Updating permissions in a profile can affect other users who are assigned to the same profile. 
    > - Users must have permissions to all the objects that are added to the Copilot for Sales from admin settings in Teams.
