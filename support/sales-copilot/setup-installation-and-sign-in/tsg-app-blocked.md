## Cause

The Microsoft Power Platform app in Salesforce CRM is blocked by an administrator.

Copilot for Sales connects to Salesforce CRM through the **Microsoft Power Platform** connected app. When the **Microsoft Power Platform** app is blocked by an administrator, the Salesforce authentication process fails with the error message.

## Resolution

Copilot for Sales uses the **Microsoft Power Platform** connected app to connect to Salesforce CRM. Ensure that the connected app isn't blocked in Salesforce CRM.

1. Sign in to Salesforce CRM as an administrator.
1. Go to **Setup** > **Platform Tools** > **Apps** > **Connected Apps** > **Connected Apps OAuth Usage**.
1. For the **Microsoft Power Platform** app, select **Unblock**.

    The **Microsoft Power Platform** app disappears from the list, but it's unblocked.

    After the first successful sign-in from the first user using Copilot for Sales, the **Microsoft Power Platform** app appears in the list again.
