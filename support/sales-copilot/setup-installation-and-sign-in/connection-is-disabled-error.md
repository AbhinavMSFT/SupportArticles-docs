:::image type="content" source="media/connection-is-disabled-error/connection-disabled-error-from-token-exchange.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the disabled Salesforce connection error.":::

## Cause

The Salesforce connection is disabled on the default environment.

The Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policy is enabled on the default environment in the tenant thereby blocking the Salesforce connector. Therefore, existing connections to Salesforce have been disabled.

## Resolution

1. Sign out from Copilot for Sales and close the Copilot for Sales pane.
1. Reopen the Copilot for Sales pane and sign in to Salesforce.

> [!NOTE]
> If the issue isn't resolved, see [Unable to sign in to Salesforce due to blocked Salesforce connector](tsg-blocked-connector-sf.md) to unblock the Salesforce connector in DLP policy.
