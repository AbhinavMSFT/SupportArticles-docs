## Cause

The Salesforce connector is blocked on the default environment.

## Resolution

You must unblock the Salesforce connector in the DLP policy to resolve this issue.

1. Sign in to the Power Platform admin center with admin credentials.
1. In the left navigation pane, select **Policies** > **Data policies**.
1. Select the data policy that blocks the Salesforce connector, and then select **Edit Policy**.
1. On the **Prebuilt connectors** step, move the **Salesforce** connector to either **Business** or **Non-business**.
1. Go through rest of the steps, and then select **Update policy**.
