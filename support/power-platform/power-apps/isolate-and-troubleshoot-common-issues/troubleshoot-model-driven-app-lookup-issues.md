# Troubleshoot Lookup issues in model-driven apps

The Simple Lookup control's behavior is defined by the Lookup field and its relationships, the assigned view, the entity's Quick Find view, search string, and any applied custom script. The control combines these to build a fetchXML for retrieving search results.

Issues with this operation usually fall into one of these categories:

- Search results are incorrect
- Views are incorrect
- Result fields are incorrect

## Search results are incorrect

If the Lookup's search results are missing items or include unexpected items, inspect the fetchXML of the outgoing network request that the control makes.

If the fetchXML is incorrect then there may be a problem with:

  1. The Quick Find view and/or the view being searched on, such as
      - missing search fields, or
      - missing the primary field, or
      - the view includes a filter that is blocking results.
  2. A client script is modifying the control's behavior with API such as [`addPreSearch`](/power-apps/developer/model-driven-apps/clientapi/reference/controls/addpresearch) or [`addCustomFilter`](/power-apps/developer/model-driven-apps/clientapi/reference/controls/addcustomfilter).
  3. The user does not have correct permissions for some of entities. Note that this won't necessarily be apparent in the network response other than with an omission of results.

If the fetchXML is correct but the data returned is incorrect then the issue is on the server, such as a misconfigured relationship.

## Views are incorrect

If an entity or view is missing from the Lookup views or results, or the default view incorrect, then:

- Verify that the entity has been enabled for the app.
- Verify that the user has permissions and roles required to interact with the entity and related entities.

If the [`addCustomView`](/power-apps/developer/model-driven-apps/clientapi/reference/controls/addcustomview) API is being applied then:

- Verify that the `viewId` is not already used.

## Result fields are incorrect

The Lookup control's search results are presented in the order that they are listed for that entity's Lookup view, with blank fields being replaced with the next non-blank field. This means that a multi-entity Lookup can have results with different orders of fields if the entities' Lookup views have different field combinations.
