# Offline sync errors troubleshooting

Data sync can fail in offline-enabled apps due to various errors. Depending on the type of app, the error message might appear differently.

## Model-driven apps including Field Service

If the offline sync status icon indicates a warning or error, you can tap on it to open the Device Status page to see more details. In the Device Status page, you'll see your current device state and details from the last sync. If an error or warning occurred, you'll see a message describing what went wrong.  

See [View offline sync status](/power-apps/mobile/offline-sync-icon#types-of-offline-syncs).

## Canvas apps (preview)

In canvas apps, sync errors might occur when opening the app for the first time. A dialogue will appear with the error message. See [Work with canvas apps offline (preview)](/power-apps/mobile/canvas-mobile-offline-working) for details.
