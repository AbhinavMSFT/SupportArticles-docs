# Can't sign in to Power Automate for desktop

This article provides resolutions and workarounds to several sign in related issues. 

## Generic sign in or sign out issues

Power Automate for desktop uses a file named **msalcache.bin3** to acquire tokens and authenticate users.

If you encounter errors while signing in or signing out, erase all the stored tokens by deleting this file. 

To delete the file, navigate to ```%localappdata%\Microsoft\Power Automate Desktop\Cache\MSI``` for MSI installations or ```%localappdata%\Microsoft\Power Automate Desktop\Cache\Store``` for MS Store installations. 

> [!NOTE]
> If the **AppData** folder isn't visible in your user folder, try to [display hidden files](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/show-hidden-files-0320fe58-0117-fd59-6851-9b7f9840fdb2). 

After deleting the **msalcache.bin3** file, exit Power Automate from the system tray or restart the Power Automate service and retry signing in. 

## Web Account Manager (WAM) errors

By default, Power Automate for desktop authenticates users through the Web Account Manager (WAM); a Windows component that ships with the Operating System that acts as an authentication broker. 

Learn more about WAM and related errors in [Using MSAL.NET with Web Account Manager (WAM)] (https://aka.ms/msal-net-wam) and [Interactive with WAM](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/scenario-desktop-acquire-token-wam). 

## Wrong region selected

Before signing in, make sure you have selected your region correctly by clicking on the **Change region** option.
