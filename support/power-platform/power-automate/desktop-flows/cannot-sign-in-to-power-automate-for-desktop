# Can't sign in to Power Automate for desktop

This article provides resolutions and workarounds to several sign in related issues. 

## Generic sign in or sign out issues

Power Automate for desktop uses a file named **msalcache.bin3** to acquire tokens and authenticate users. 

If you encounter errors while signing in or signing out, try to erase all the stored tokens by deleting this file. To delete the file, navigate to %localappdata%\Microsoft\Power Automate Desktop\Cache\MSI for MSI installations or %localappdata%\Microsoft\Power Automate Desktop\Cache\Store for MS Store installations. 

 Note: If the AppData folder isn't visible in your user folder, try to display hidden files. 

After deleting the msalcache.bin3 file, exit Power Automate from the system tray or restart the Power Automate service and retry signing in.
