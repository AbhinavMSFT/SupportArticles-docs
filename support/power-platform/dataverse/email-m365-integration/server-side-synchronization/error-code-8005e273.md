# Error code 8005E273 when you test and enable mailbox

This article provides a resolution for error code 8005E273 that occurs when you test and enable a mailbox for server-side synchronization in Microsoft Dataverse.

## Symptoms

When a user tries to Test and Enable a mailbox and Microsoft 365 Account Disabled.

## Cause

When a user tries to Test and Enable a mailbox and the user associated Graph user is disabled. The Microsoft 365 account associated with the email address is not enabled in the Microsoft 365 Tenant associated with Email Server Profile.

## Resolution

1. Verify that the account is enabled and sign-in is not blocked.

   1. Go to the Microsoft 365 admin center at https://admin.cloud.microsoft.

   1. Go to **Users** > **Active users**, and select **Add a user**.
   1. In the **Set up the basics** pane, fill in the basic user information, and then select **Next**.

       - **Name** Fill in the first and last name, display name, and username.
       - **Domain** Choose the domain for the user's account. For example, if the user's username is Jakob, and the domain is contoso.com, they'll sign in by using `jakob@contoso.com`.
       - **Password settings** Choose to use the autogenerated password or to create your own strong password for the user.
       - The user must change their password after 90 days. Or you can choose to **Require this user to change their password when they first sign in**.
       - Choose whether you want to send the password in email when the user is added.

      In the Assign product licenses pane, select the location and the appropriate license for the user. If you don't have any licenses available, you can still add a user and buy additional licenses. Expand Apps and select or deselect apps to limit the apps the user has a license for. Select **Next**.

    1. In the **Optional settings** pane, expand **Roles** to make this user an admin. Expand **Profile info** to add additional information about the user.
    1. Select **Next**, review your new user's settings, make any changes you like, then select **Finish adding**, then **Close**.

2. Test and enable the mailbox again.

    1. Open the mailbox record if it isn't already open.
    2. Select the **Test & Enable Mailbox** button.
    3. Wait for the "Test & Enable" process to complete. If the test results aren't **Success**, review the **Alerts** area within the mailbox record.
