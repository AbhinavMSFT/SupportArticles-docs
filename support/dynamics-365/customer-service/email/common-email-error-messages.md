# Troubleshoot common email error messages

This article provides resolutions for common email error messages in Dynamics 365 Customer Service.

## Scenario

Sample: Configuration on **Automatic Record Creation and Update Rule**

- The **Create contact for unknown sender** option should be selected.
- Set condition criteria to **Any incoming email**.
- Add action to create a case, select **View properties**, and set the case fields per business use case.

## Error 1

In the **Customer** field of the **CASE DETAILS** section, the value of **Senders Account (Email)** is set as shown below.

#### Resolution for Error 1

To resolve this issue, keep the **Customer** field blank or set it to **{Sender(Email)}**. This allows the system to automatically create a contact for the unknown sender and link it to the case.

## Error 2

The **Customer** field is set as **{Senders Account(Email)}**, and the **Contact** field is set as **{Sender(Email)}**.

:::image type="content" source="media/common-email-error-messages/customer-contact-values.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the values set for the Customer and Contact fields.":::

This setting results in the following error in system jobs:

> An error has occurred. Try this action again. If the problem continues, check the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Community for solutions or contact your organization's Microsoft Dynamics 365 Administrator. Finally, you can contact Microsoft Support.

:::image type="content" source="media/common-email-error-messages/error-has-occured.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the details of the error that occurs due to the value set for the Customer field.":::

#### Resolution for Error 2

To resolve this issue, keep the **Customer** field blank or set it to **{Sender(Email)}**. This allows the system to automatically create a contact for the unknown sender and link it to the case.

## Error 3

The **Customer** and **Contact** fields are set as **{Sender(Email)}**.

:::image type="content" source="media/common-email-error-messages/customer-value-set-case-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the value set for the Customer and Contact fields.":::

This setting results in the following error in system jobs:

> The specified contact doesn't belong to the contact that was specified in the customer field. Remove the value from the contact field, or select a contact associated to the selected customer, and then try again.

:::image type="content" source="media/common-email-error-messages/specified-contact-not-belong-contact-error.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the details of the error that states the specified contact doesn't belong to the contact that was specified in the Customer field.":::

#### Resolution for Error 3

To resolve this issue, leave the **Contact** field blank and set the **Customer** field either to blank or to **{Sender(Email)}**.

## Validation steps

You must validate the configuration and validation steps provided in the following table to understand the main cause of the issue and resolve it.

|Option in Automatic Record Creation and Update Rule in Service Management  |If selected as  |Validation steps  |Outcome  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Create a case if a valid entitlement exists for the customer     |  Yes     |  Validate that an active entitlement exists for the customer. Valid active entitlement is evaluated as below:  </br> - If the sender of the email is a contact with a parent account, then Dynamics 365 Customer Service creates a case if the contact's parent account has a valid entitlement, and the contact is listed in the **Contacts** section of the entitlement </br> Or, </br> - If the **Contacts** section is empty (which means that the entitlement is applicable to all contacts for the customer) |   A case is created.      |
|Create a case from an email sent by unknown senders     |   Yes       |        For any incoming email from an unknown sender |     - A case is created. </br>  - A contact is also created for the unknown sender.|
|     |   Yes      |    For an incoming email with email address of inactive account or contact     |   - A case is created. </br> - An inactive account or contact is activated.|
|     |   No      |     For an incoming email with email address of active account or contact   |  A case is created.       |
|    |     No    |      For an incoming email sent by record type other than account or contact   |    No case is created.     |
|  |   No      |     For an incoming email with email address of inactive account or contact    |  No case is created.           |
|Create a case for activities associated with a resolved case     |    Yes     |   For an incoming email related to a resolved case      |    A case is created.     |
|   |    Yes      |   For an incoming email related to an active case         |   No case is created.      |
