### Issue 2: Browser Microphone permissions

#### Root cause
The issue is often caused by the seller not enabling microphone permissions on the browser.

#### Resolution
To enable microphone permissions for the browser, follow these steps:
1. Click on "Allow" in the pop-up window next to the lock icon located below to the address bar:  
   * On Google Chrome:  
   ![Chrome allow microphone](media/seller-voice-unheard-by-other-customer/chrome-allow-microphone.png)  
   * On Microsoft Edge:  
   ![Edge allow microphone](media/seller-voice-unheard-by-other-customer/edge-allow-microphone.png)
2. If you have previously disabled the microphone permissions, you can re-enable it by clicking the same lock icon:  
   * On Google Chrome, click on the toggle located next to "Microphone":  
   ![Chrome enable microphone](media/seller-voice-unheard-by-other-customer/chrome-enable-microphone.png)   
   * On Microsoft Edge, click on "Block" and then select "Allow":
