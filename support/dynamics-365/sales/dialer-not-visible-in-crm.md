# Teams dialer isn't visible in Dynamics 365 Sales

This article provides resolutions for an issue where the Microsoft Teams dialer isn't visible in Dynamics 365 Sales.

## Symptoms

A seller can't see the Microsoft Teams dialer in Dynamics 365 Sales.

## Cause 1: Cached browsing data

#### Resolution

To resolve this issue, follow the steps in the [Microsoft Teams dialer basic troubleshooting steps](dialer-basic-troubleshooting.md).

## Cause 2: Missing the Read privileges assigned to the security roles

To see the Teams dialer, the security roles that are assigned to the user should have the Read privileges for the **Teams Dialer Admin settings** entity.

These Read privileges should be granted automatically for the Sales Manager and Salesperson security roles.

#### Resolution

To solve the issue with the read privileges, follow the mitigation steps:

1. Sign in to the [Sales Hub app](/dynamics365/sales/intro-saleshub) with an adminitrator account.

2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Advanced Settings**.
