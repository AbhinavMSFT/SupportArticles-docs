The problem arises when sellers don't have the necessary Teams license or a phone number assigned to their account.

1. Go to dialer settings page (Dialer settings page available only on the 'Sales Hub' application).
2. Remove the custom app from the 'Advanced settings' dropdown.
3. Click update.
4. After the page finish saving, refresh the page.
5. Add the custom app to the 'Advanced settings' dropdown.
