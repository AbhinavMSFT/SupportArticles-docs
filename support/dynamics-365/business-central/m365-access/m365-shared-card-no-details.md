# Troubleshoot "Card from shared link is minimal and doesn't include Details button"

This article helps you troubleshoot the error message "Card from shared link is minimal and doesn't include Details button" in Business Central.

## Symptoms 

When a Microsoft 365 license holder without a Business Central license shares a Business Central link in Teams, it automatically expands into a card that has no useful information and only shows Business Central with no **Details** button.

## Cause

Users who have a Microsoft 365 license but no Business Central license aren't allowed to share links as cards. If the user has the Business Central app for Teams installed and pastes a link into the compose area, then only a minimal card is displayed.
