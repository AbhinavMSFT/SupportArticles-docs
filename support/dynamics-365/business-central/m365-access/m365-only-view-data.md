# Troubleshoot "You shared a link in Teams, but users get a message that they can only view data"

## Symptoms

When you share a link in Teams as a Business Central user, others get the error "When accessing Business Central with a Microsoft 365 license, you can only view data in Microsoft Teams".

## Cause

When sharing a Business Central link to a Teams chat or channels, navigating a link will always navigate out of Microsoft Teams where the data no longer becomes accessible to a person having a Microsoft 365 license.

## Resolution

When sharing pages or records, either include the link preview as a card, or share data as a tab in the chat or channel.
