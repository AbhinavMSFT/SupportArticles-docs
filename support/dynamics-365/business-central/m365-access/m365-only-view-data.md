# "You shared a link in Teams, but users get a message that they can only view data"

## Symptoms

When you share a link in Teams as a Business Central user, others get the error "When accessing Business Central with a Microsoft 365 license, you can only view data in Microsoft Teams".

## Cause

When someone shares a Business Central link to a Teams chat or channels, navigating a link will always navigate out of Microsoft Teams where the data no longer becomes accessible to a person having a Microsoft 365 license.

## Resolution

When you shares pages or records do one of the follwoing:

- Include the link preview as a card. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/across-teams-tab).
- Share data as a tab in the chat or channel. [Learn more](/dynamics365/business-central/across-teams-tab).
