# Troubleshoot issues connecting to Financial reporting

Issue: You receive the error "Unable to Connect to the Financial reporting server".

* Determine if the issue occurs in Chrome and Edge internet browsers.
* If the issue occurs only in one browser, it could be ClickOnce issue. 
* When you get the connection error message, select **Test** to test the connection to see what message appears. 
* The issue could be the result of another user not having access to Financial reporting. If a user doesn't have access, they'll receive a message stating they don't have permission.
* If the issue occurs on multiple browsers, make sure the time clock on your workstation is set to Auto.
* Work with a user that has security administrator's rights in Dynamics 365 Finance, and admin rights to the network domain, to sign in to your workstation to see if they are able to connect. If they're able to
  connect, the issue might be related to network permissions.
* On the workstation, temporarily disable the firewall. If you are then able to connect to Report Designer the issue is with your firewall. Work with your organization's IT department to resolve the issue.
